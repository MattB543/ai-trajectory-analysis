Main scenario

What if AI became the centre of a global arms race between great powers?

By 2026, the U.S. and China treat AI as a strategic asset, blending public and private resources into secret defence projects. Breakthroughs in cyber capabilities fuel escalation, while Taiwan’s semiconductor dominance turns the country into a potential flashpoint. By 2027, both countries deploy AI-enhanced military systems. Europe struggles to shape the rivalry. A proposed pause fails over verification concerns, and the AI race spills into geopolitics.

By 2029, Hot war asks: what if AI turns a tense standoff into an escalating military conflict, driven by autonomous systems and digital miscalculation? Multipolar world asks: what if the arms race ends not with war, but with a fragile equilibrium built on mistrust, restraint, and competing blocs?

Baseline assumptions for this scenario

    AI becomes the ultimate national security asset: Both the US and China view advanced AI as a technology that could determine not just economic dominance but military superiority and global influence. Politicians frame frontier AI systems as strategic assets whose possession will shape the world order. This shared belief triggers massive state-backed partnerships aimed at achieving and maintaining global leadership, with particular focus on military applications— from autonomous weapons to cyber warfare.
    The race to catch up intensifies competition: While the United States leads in advanced AI development—hosting the world’s top chip designers and several leading AI companies—other nations, particularly China, work frantically to close the gap. These catch-up efforts trigger defensive moves and countermeasures, transforming technological progress into an active geopolitical contest.
    No one can verify what anyone else is doing: Despite various proposals, there’s no reliable way to prove who is training cutting-edge AI models, where they’re doing it, or what adversaries’ AI systems are capable of. Suggested solutions like mandatory compute registries remain voluntary experiments. Without credible verification, the logic of arms control breaks down, pushing nations toward secrecy and pre-emptive action.
    Control over chips becomes a geopolitical weapon: Advanced AI depends on a handful of vulnerable points in the global supply chain: Taiwan’s chip fabrication plants, Dutch lithography equipment, and American-designed AI chips. US export controls create a “compute drought” in China, and despite massive investment, China’s domestic semiconductor industry doesn’t catch up. These chokepoints intensify tensions, particularly regarding Taiwan’s strategic importance.

Mid 2025 – mid 2026

By mid-2025, AI is increasingly seen as the centerpiece of a new technological arms race between the United States and China. The ongoing trade war between the two countries has escalated, fueling a broader wave of anti-China sentiment in America. Government officials and AI company CEOs frame the AI race as one the U.S. must win at all costs.

Pundits call it the Second Cold War—a global struggle between democracy and autocracy. Many believe future AI systems will revolutionise warfare. Experts point to advances in intelligence gathering, cyber attacks, autonomous drone swarms, and missile defence. If AI companies are to be believed, these systems may even enable entirely novel forms of warfare beyond human conception.

American foreign policy grows singularly focused on China. Determined not to be distracted by other conflicts, the U.S. partially withdraws support for Ukraine. At the same time, the President seeks to weaken the Russia-China alliance through symbolic and practical overtures to Russia. U.S.-Europe relations hit a new low, as the EU is left scrambling to defend its borders.

Throughout 2025, American and Chinese AI systems make rapid progress, particularly in formal domains like software engineering. National security agencies take notice, as the same systems are becoming skilled at hacking too. The CIA, NSA, and China’s Ministry of State Security gain early access to their countries’ most advanced models. These systems operate around the clock—helping to plant backdoors, gathering intelligence, and defending against cyber intrusions.

With AI analysing massive datasets, U.S. intelligence uncovers new evidence suggesting China is preparing to invade Taiwan in 2029. The administration is divided on whether the U.S. should intervene. The debate is not just ideological—classified wargames suggest they may not be able to defend Taiwan even if they try.

Meanwhile, commercial AI applications flourish. New autonomous systems become faster and more reliable. Tech-savvy companies start automating desk work, and organise their workflows around AI agents.

In Europe, poor relations with the U.S., combined with the White House’s ties to American tech companies, drive many organisations away from American AI tools. Some adopt Chinese alternatives. European systems lag roughly nine months behind, building on earlier Chinese open-source efforts. Although AI briefly became a European priority in early 2025, geopolitical upheaval has pushed it aside. European nations shift focus to re-industrialisation, forming new alliances, and harmonising defence procurement.

At dinner tables and in community spaces, conversations increasingly reflect these rising geopolitical tensions. Families with ties to Taiwan or the military feel the pressure most acutely. Parents worry about the world their children will inherit, comparing the mood to the sixties. Tech workers debate the ethics of their work, with some changing jobs to avoid moral compromise.
Mid 2026 – late 2026

FrontierAI—the leading American AI company—demonstrates a breakthrough in AI cyber capabilities to the U.S. National Security Council. Their latest model has independently discovered zero-day vulnerabilities in widely used software. This further convinces U.S. leadership that AI will become decisive in intelligence and military applications.

With Chinese competitor UnboundAI close behind and power constraints limiting the construction of new American data centres, the President fears China might outpace the U.S. Bold action is needed.

The President initiates a public-private partnership between the government and AI sector to accelerate strategic AI development. In a series of government-owned, air-gapped data centres, industry and government will collaborate on next-generation AI systems and their integration into intelligence and military applications. Though FrontierAI pushes for exclusive collaboration, the President involves all three leading AI labs to accelerate progress. Before the infrastructure is operational, algorithmic progress will be shared more freely between these companies.

The existence of this “AI Manhattan Project” is kept secret between a small group of people: an information silo is established that contains 200 trusted employees and government officials. Other AI company staff are told vague lies and are increasingly directed to focus on productisation.

China quickly discovers the U.S. project. Alarmed by its implications, Chinese leadership accelerates efforts to close the AI capability gap. Under presidential directive, China’s AI companies form a unified consortium with the government and cease publishing model weights. They pool computing resources across companies and plan to relocate researchers to a newly built AI zone near the Three Gorges Dam.

With U.S. export controls still limiting access to cutting-edge chips, developing domestic semiconductor capabilities was already a priority in China. Now, the government directs SMIC to go all-in on AI chip production, at the cost of other applications like chips for mobile phones. It also provides even more financial resources to expedite manufacturing.

But better hardware isn’t enough; China also needs to improve algorithmic efficiency. Rather than starting from scratch, they consider a shortcut: if China had access to the model weights of the American AI systems, that would instantly level the playing field. And so, the Ministry of State Security decides to infiltrate FrontierAI’s servers.

That said, they don’t act yet. If the theft is discovered, the American labs will harden their security and China will not realistically get another attempt— better to wait until the American systems get even more sophisticated.
Late 2026 – early 2027

Rumors spread that China is accelerating its plans to “reunify” with Taiwan. An invasion or blockade has become increasingly attractive over the past year: AI is now a national priority, and Taiwan still manufactures nearly all of the advanced chips used to train and serve American AI systems. With China already cut off from these chips, seizing control of Taiwan could deal a major blow to the U.S.—even if it’s unlikely China could operate the chip fabrication plants without destruction.

News of China’s megaproject also reaches the media. Satellite images reveal vast construction sites in Hubei Province, while prominent Chinese AI researchers have gone silent on social media. People scrutinise recent American executive orders for hints of an equivalent American project. Both the U.S. government and AI companies deny such off-the-book collaboration exists, though they acknowledge the concerning Chinese developments.

Meanwhile, a new wave of AI systems begins automating software development at scale. Entry-level programming jobs disappear first. Tools capable of generating production-ready code, performing bug fixes across several code bases, and even designing entire applications dramatically reduce the need for junior engineers. This triggers wider concern about job displacement across the tech industry and beyond. Layoffs ripple through large firms, while universities struggle to justify traditional computer science education. World GDP edges upward on the back of these headline productivity gains, but economists warn the benefits are lopsided—concentrated in software, finance, and a few advanced economies, with little diffusion to lagging sectors or regions.

On the other side of the Atlantic, Russia exploits waning American support for Ukraine: by March 2027, it has gained significant territory in the eastern regions, reviving debates about the need for nuclear proliferation in Europe.
Early 2027 – late 2027

In the U.S., the new air-gapped data centre campus nears completion. With time running out, China decides to act. They successfully infiltrate FrontierAI’s servers and extract model weights from multiple recent systems with help from an insider who had been with the company for two years.

The U.S. quickly discovers the breach—but instead of making it public, senior intelligence and national security officials choose a calculated silence. Behind the scenes, preparations begin for a multi-pronged response. The National Security Agency launches an aggressive counterintelligence operation, quietly expanding its reach into the Chinese AI ecosystem. All employees at American top-tier AI firms are subjected to intensive background checks, with retroactive scrutiny of financial activity and personal ties. At the same time, the Department of Commerce accelerates planning for a new round of export controls targeting China’s AI supply chain. Finally, Cyber Command initiates a covert retaliatory campaign, probing vulnerabilities in China’s digital infrastructure and AI research hubs.

One month later, the U.S. invokes the Foreign Direct Product Rule to block European semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies from selling tools or spare parts to China. Previously, older machines and parts were still allowed to enter the country. The sanctions further limit China’s ability to manufacture AI chips domestically.

The EU reacts furiously, having received no warning from the U.S. European intelligence has meanwhile uncovered the American Manhattan Project. Fed up, the European Commission President subtly confirms its existence in a speech condemning America’s reckless AI race with China. This triggers a diplomatic crisis that eventually subsides after the U.S. threatens to withdraw American AI products from Europe entirely.

Europe feels trapped between the U.S. and China. They depend on American AI products to boost productivity and on the limited American support for Ukraine that’s left. At the same time, they desperately want to cut back on their U.S. dependencies. Stuck in a corner, European leaders soften some statements and announce a new AI investment initiative to project strength. Economists warn the sanctions-driven chip squeeze is already casting a shadow over the global outlook; a rush into safe-haven assets signals that investors are bracing for turbulence.

By June, 2027, China has fully caught up with the U.S. in AI capabilities. But they still face challenges running the stolen AI models efficiently on their own hardware. As they witness the power of American AI systems—capable of finding vulnerabilities, developing clever military strategies, and functioning as professional software engineers—Chinese leadership grows increasingly concerned about losing the AI arms race. The CCP starts to view American AI dominance as a potential existential threat to the party.

Wary of data poisoning, China avoids directly integrating the stolen models into their military operations. They do use them to accelerate training their own next-generation systems. Meanwhile, preparations for Taiwan operations proceed on schedule.

With both state projects now a public secret, people grow increasingly alarmed about the unfolding AI arms race. Recent months have seen few releases from leading American and Chinese AI labs, fueling rumors that their governments are keeping advances to themselves. Congressional hearings involve administration officials and AI company CEOs defending the public-private partnership while revealing minimal information. Protests demanding transparency erupt in multiple countries but see little effect.

In university classrooms and online forums, students debate whether to pursue careers in AI given the field’s militarisation. Some professors resign from research positions, unwilling to contribute to what they see as dangerous escalation. A rise in political activism among tech workers creates tension at companies with government contracts. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens find themselves increasingly divided between those who trust their governments to manage these technologies responsibly and those who fear the worst-case scenarios.
Late 2027 – mid 2028

The U.S. Manhattan Project now operates at full capacity. Drawing on distinct algorithmic insights from the three major AI companies—and leveraging an army of AI agents—progress has accelerated dramatically. Software is now primarily written by AI systems, with humans contributing mainly in management and ideation roles. Meanwhile, autonomous drones have become reliable even without network access, running compact AI systems on local GPUs.

Warfare is set to change permanently—not just in tools, but in tempo and logic. AI systems can increasingly manage logistics, battlefield simulation, route planning, and multi-theater coordination, compressing what once took hours of human analysis into seconds. Tactical decisions can be executed by agents running locally on hardened GPUs. In the air, autonomous drones conduct practice dogfights, spoof radar, and adapt tactics in real time. On the ground, artillery platforms can rely on AI-predicted troop movements to optimise strikes. In wargames, human commanders no longer plan operations—they approve simulations.

China is again falling somewhat behind in raw AI capabilities, unable to match the U.S. due to weaker infrastructure and a lack of tacit technical knowledge. Still, it retains advantages in drone hardware, manufacturing capacity, and electricity availability. Its centralised data centre campus is expanding rapidly.

Rising geopolitical tensions related to AI have prompted security experts to warn of potential cyberattacks targeting crucial AI infrastructure. This warning is echoed in public discussions, contributing to a growing sense of anxiety. Initially enthusiastic about AI, younger generations are now increasingly uneasy, with many viewing AI not as a sign of advancement but as a catalyst for international conflict.

In February 2028, the U.S. launches a successful retaliatory cyberattack on China’s megaproject, disabling much of its power supply, and setting back Chinese progress by a month. China responds by disrupting power grids near American data centres, but gas-powered backup generators limit the damage.

On the losing end of the exchange, the Chinese President grows increasingly desperate. Projections suggest the U.S. could achieve superhuman AI systems before 2029, driven by AI-enabled self-improvement loops. Neither nation has a clear plan for managing this intelligence explosion. Safety—once a central concern—has been sidelined in the face of geopolitical urgency.

The more pressing concern is that superhuman AI could grant the U.S. an unassailable military edge. Could advanced missile defence systems reliably intercept ICBMs? Could cyberattacks and autonomous drone swarms neutralise nuclear arsenals before they are even launched? China’s global influence may soon slip out of reach.

The Chinese President decides expedited action is necessary.

In July 2028, China presents its terms. In a globally broadcast address, the President proposes a bilateral pause on military AI development, linking the agreement to Chinese action in the Taiwan Strait. He makes clear that China is not merely defending territorial claims—but resisting the rise of a single, AI-governed world order dominated by the United States. Many countries, including even a few European states, voice partial support. The UK and India quickly jump in to lead diplomatic efforts to bring the U.S. and China to the negotiating table.

The U.S. refuses. Without a reliable verification mechanism, the administration argues, any agreement would be meaningless.

The U.S. refuses. Without a reliable verification mechanism, the administration argues, any agreement would be meaningless.

Hot war (Ending A)
Mid 2028

One month later, Chinese troops land on Taiwan’s shores. Simultaneous cyberattacks cripple Taiwanese infrastructure and target U.S. military networks across the Pacific, triggering devastating American counterattacks on China’s digital and military systems. In the fog of war, missiles strike targets across the South China Sea and U.S. bases in Japan and the Philippines.

Command structures on both sides have been largely automated. Retaliatory strikes launch within seconds, with minimal human oversight. As Chinese amphibious vehicles deploy on Taiwan’s beaches and PLA troops clash with Taiwanese forces, Chinese military units experience a massive communications blackout. Minutes later, thousands of American drones launch from hidden caches— storage units disguised in warehouses. Facilities of the leading Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer erupt into fireballs soon after.

Warfare has entered a new era. Billion-dollar aircraft carriers are sunk within hours by coordinated drone swarms. Missiles are redirected mid-flight by AI-enhanced jamming. Cyber systems execute attacks with zero review. Human decision-making is too slow.

Behind the scenes, AI systems manage logistics, simulate adversary responses, and recommend both escalatory and de-escalatory actions. Military leadership defers more and more decisions to them. War has become a sequence of algorithmic exchanges.

As the tide turns in favour of the U.S., the Chinese President takes a gamble. With momentum slipping and core infrastructure under threat, he authorises precision strikes on several key U.S. data centres. The goal: disrupt cloud-based inference crucial to American military operations. Several of the strikes hit their mark.

In response, the U.S. targets data centres on mainland China and issues a chilling warning: any further attacks on domestic AI infrastructure will be treated as a first strike under nuclear protocol.

The world braces for what comes next.

Multipolar world (Ending B)
Mid 2028 – late 2029

One month later, Chinese naval vessels encircle Taiwan, triggering a global crisis. The U.S. issues a 72-hour ultimatum demanding an end to the blockade or face severe consequences. In response, the Chinese President—having already demonstrated a willingness to take risks—threatens further escalation. His warning is stark: China does not rule out nuclear action unless the U.S. halts its secret AI developments.

A nuclear standoff ensues. Unwilling to risk catastrophe, the U.S. President offers concessions, and a fragile equilibrium begins to take shape. America agrees to pause select military AI programmes—conditional on China doing the same and unilaterally lifting key tariffs on U.S. exports. In addition, China must guarantee continued access to critical minerals essential for semiconductor and battery production, including rare earth elements. In exchange, the U.S. will forego additional export restrictions on AI hardware and refrain from targeting Chinese infrastructure. Both sides walk away uneasy—but willing, for now, to de-escalate.

Yet, beneath the surface, no one has a clear plan for how to enforce the AI truce. Neither side can verify the other’s compliance with confidence. They know the locations of each other’s major data centres, but both suspect hidden facilities. No independently verified registry of AI chips exists, and satellite surveillance cannot detect smaller, underground installations.

Amid deep mistrust, the EU and several neutral countries step in to mediate. A multinational monitoring initiative is launched: third-party auditors are stationed at key data centres and chip fabrication plants, supported by satellite imagery, tamper-evident cameras and hardware tracking systems. The principle is simple—if auditors can verify that all existing and future hardware is not being used for banned military purposes, most AI workloads can continue.

But serious concerns remain. Could auditors be coerced? Could surveillance footage be altered or delayed? Could future efficiency gains allow dangerous training runs to take place on smaller, underground clusters?

At the same time, a second crisis begins to unfold—this time around AI for consumer use. Leading companies are quietly moving to commercialise models that were previously limited to government contracts, eager to monetise their capabilities. But distinguishing between harmless inference and covert post-training is now increasingly difficult. The technical boundary between consumer use and possible military exploitation is rapidly blurring.

AI systems can now be finetuned on a relatively small set of highly curated data points. Novel techniques use vast inference compute to identify precisely the knowledge a model needs to improve—workloads that appear indistinguishable from regular consumer usage. A fierce global debate follows. Eventually, governments impose sweeping restrictions on commercial applications. Markets crash even further. The U.S.–China standoff, once a military concern, has now frozen AI’s economic potential.

For citizens, the new world feels surreal. People live under constant threat of conflict and with the knowledge that powerful, secret AI systems exist—systems that, if released, could transform the economy. Education systems struggle to prepare students for this uncertain future. Many workers stop investing in career development, choosing instead to spend more time with their families.

Tensions flare periodically. Each time, one nation accuses the other of violating the agreement. Cyberattacks hit AI infrastructure. Threats of ballistic strikes follow. But the pattern repeats: neither side is willing to escalate over unverifiable intelligence. Crises recede—for now.

Meanwhile, the international monitoring group gains power. With each flare-up, the U.S. and China reluctantly expand its authority. By early 2029, this leads to an unintended consequence: the EU, now at the center of global enforcement, successfully argues for its own advanced AI capabilities. Their reasoning is simple—how can they monitor what they don’t understand?

The U.S. and China agree, cautiously. But a new dilemma emerges: who will verify them?

A compromise is reached. The U.S. and China will jointly oversee European AI supply chains. A three-way balance of power begins to emerge.

The world fractures into three blocs. Alliances within each bloc grow stronger with every crisis. Hopes for peace now rest on one possibility: hardware-based verification. If conflict can be avoided for two more years, existing chips may be replaced with new tamper-proof variants—designed to record and restrict all training activity.

If that works, perhaps the world can return to a new kind of normal.
