The d/acc scenario (decentralized, democratic, differential, defensive acceleration) sketches a plausible 2035 in which society chooses not to slow AI but to selectively accelerate technologies that distribute power, strengthen defenses, and enable plural governance, producing a hybrid world of interoperable federated systems and remaining centralized backbones; a sequence of crises—the 2025 Semiconductor Siege, a 2026 Centralized AI Collapse, supply-chain shocks and coordinated disinformation and bioattacks—prompted regulators, investors, and communities to fund federated AI, privacy-preserving cryptography, open manufacturing, and interoperable governance protocols, leading to resilient outcomes like revenue-generating microgrids, dual-use local manufacturing, federated health networks with AI fiduciaries, cooperative security collectives, competitive local governance (forkable laws, jurisdictional routers, safety-netted DAOs), and a multipolar finance layer combining TradFi and DeFi with quadratic funding and proof-of-personhood protections; these changes made crisis coordination faster in many cases (interoperable city-state stacks, federated AGI meshes deemed “safe enough for now”) and created new economic and social norms (portable digital citizenship, patient-controlled health data, live versioned science, modular education), but also introduced persistent frictions—coordination costs and cognitive load, interoperability and standards gaps, resilience inequality, protocol-capture and governance capture risks, offense–defense asymmetries and “small-kills-all” threats—and left core unanswered questions about which systems should be centralized versus decentralized, how to scale coordination without recreating central points of control, how to sustain trust and democratic legitimacy, and whether public-goods funding and protocol governance can resist gaming, making d/acc an experimentally promising but contested pathway that trades efficiency for fault-tolerance and pluralism while demanding continual technical, institutional, and cultural adaptation.
