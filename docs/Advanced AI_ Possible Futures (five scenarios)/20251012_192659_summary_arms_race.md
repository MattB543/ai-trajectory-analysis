Between 2025 and 2029 the United States and China transform advanced AI into the central strategic asset of a new global arms race—driven by assumptions that frontier AI will determine military dominance, that no reliable verification of rival capabilities is possible, and that semiconductor chokepoints (notably Taiwan, Dutch lithography, and U.S. chips) are geopolitical weapons—prompting massive, secretive state–industry projects, tighter export controls, and escalating cyber and counterintelligence operations. In 2026–27 the U.S. launches a covert “AI Manhattan Project” (air‑gapped government–industry data centres) after an American lab demonstrates autonomous cyber-exploitation, China consolidates its AI firms into a state-backed consortium and prioritises domestic chip production, and Chinese operatives steal model weights from a leading U.S. lab, triggering U.S. sanctions, covert retaliation, and a diplomatic rift with Europe. As AI automates software engineering and military decision‑making, autonomous drones, rapid cyberattacks, and AI agents compress the tempo of conflict and unsettle tech workforces and economies; by 2028 both sides conduct damaging cyber strikes and China issues a public demand to pause military AI tied to Taiwan, which the U.S. rejects for lack of verifiable safeguards. The story then splits: in a “hot war” ending a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan in mid‑2028 escalates into fast, automated kinetic and cyber exchanges that strike data centres and critical infrastructure and bring nuclear brinkmanship into play; in a “multipolar” ending a tense blockade and ultimatum produce a shaky negotiated pause, multinational monitoring and sweeping commercial restrictions, and the emergence of three rival blocs (U.S., China, EU) whose uneasy truce depends on imperfect audits and hopes for future tamper‑proof hardware to restore more stable verification and economic normalcy.
