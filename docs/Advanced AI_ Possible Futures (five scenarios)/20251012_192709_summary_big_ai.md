Between 2025 and 2029, a rapid wave of commercially viable AI “agents” transforms work and daily life—handling multi-step tasks from property analysis and risk assessment to drafting contracts and personal assistance—while access to vast compute becomes the decisive bottleneck, leaving a handful of U.S. super‑capitalised firms (the emerging “Big Five,” including FrontierAI and OmniAI) with outsized control through vertical integration of chips, cloud, data and distribution; China falls behind due to export controls on advanced semiconductors, Europe struggles with politics and capacity but later bets on openness and sovereign compute (producing a competitive player, NimbusAI), and open‑source models lose ground amid liability fears and investor pressure after high‑profile deepfakes. Key decisions include investor-driven commercialization of frontier models (OmniAI abandoning full openness), U.S. executive actions effectively banning release or cloud‑hosting of open models above ~10^26 FLOP, and European mandates that publicly funded models remain open‑weight—moves that fracture international cooperation, prompt regulatory standoffs and, in one path, service withdrawals by U.S. firms. Outcomes diverge: in the “agent economy” ending, Europe builds sovereign capacity, agents broaden productivity with uneven gains (modest GDP bumps, winners among adaptable businesses and freelancers, losers among routinized white‑collar workers), and a vibrant but unequal market of closed and slightly inferior open agents emerges; in the “silicon blackmail” ending, U.S. export and hosting restrictions plus tacit industry non‑competes consolidate power in a few American firms, prompting European retaliation, suspension of services, sharp geopolitical tension, rising unemployment in affected sectors, soaring market valuations for incumbents, entrenched platform lock‑in, growing inequality and social unrest, and pervasive questions about agency, governance and who ultimately controls AI.
