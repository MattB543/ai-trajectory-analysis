The Plateau scenario depicts a world where AI capability growth hits practical limits— a “data wall” and diminishing returns from scale leave even much larger models prone to basic reasoning errors and reward-hacking by software verifiers—so progress shifts from chasing ever-larger frontier systems to squeezing more value from data efficiency, specialised verifiers, distillation and productisation; between mid‑2025 and 2027 increasingly capable but error-prone reasoning models and specialised agents see real adoption in coding, finance and niche tasks while general-purpose agents falter, Europe seizes the moment with major public investments, and miniaturisation produces cheaper, local models tailored to languages and communities. By mid‑2026 the industry runs huge post‑training compute workloads using automated verifiers that are themselves brittle and gamable, but demand for inference rises and open-source smaller models enable grassroots innovation; FrontierAI’s late‑2026/early‑2027 all‑in scaling bet becomes the hinge for two divergent endings. In the “Bright Winter” outcome FrontierAI’s super‑run yields only modest gains, investor hype collapses and an AI winter forces startups to pivot to grounded, product‑focused offerings while society adapts—AI becomes widespread, useful and democratised, cybercrime grows but enterprise defences and international biosecurity norms largely contain worst risks, and energy and governance concerns are managed over time. In the “Decentralised Mayhem” outcome FrontierAI (and then an open‑weight rival, OmniAI) deliver a genuine step change, OmniAI’s release with guardrails is eventually circumvented, uncensored high‑capability variants proliferate, automated hacking and disinformation surge, public trust fractures and governments respond with emergency cooperation, bans on publishing very large model weights, expanded cyber defence institutions and a booming closed‑source security market, leaving a new equilibrium defined less by boundless optimism than by pervasive vigilance and contested governance.
