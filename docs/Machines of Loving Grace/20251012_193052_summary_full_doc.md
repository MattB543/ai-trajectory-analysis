The essay argues that while focusing on AI risks is necessary, we should not underestimate the radically positive world powerful AI could create if developed and governed well: defined as expert-level, internet-connected models that can run many instances and autonomously perform complex, real-world tasks, such systems could—within a 5–10 year window after arrival—compress decades of scientific progress into a few years by dramatically increasing returns to intelligence, though progress will be limited by the speed of the physical world, data scarcity, intrinsic complexity, human constraints, and physical laws. The author highlights five high-impact areas—biology and health, neuroscience and mental health, economic development and poverty, peace and governance, and work and meaning—and predicts that AI could accelerate discovery of transformative measurement tools and therapies (e.g., vaccines, CRISPR improvements, cell therapies), largely eliminate infectious disease and most cancers, enable genetic prevention, greatly expand biological freedom and possibly double healthy human lifespan, cure or vastly improve treatment for most mental illnesses through combined molecular, measurement, computational, and behavioral advances, and translate many gains to the developing world via smarter distribution, agricultural and climate technologies, and optimized economic policies—though equitable access is not automatic and will require active policy, philanthropy, and institutional reform. On geopolitics, the essay warns AI can empower both autocrats and democracies and thus calls for democracies to coordinate an “entente” to secure supply chains, set norms, and use AI to defend free information and strengthen institutions, while also exploring ways AI could improve legal impartiality and public service delivery. Finally, the author acknowledges profound uncertainties about employment and meaning—arguing people can retain purpose even if AI outperforms them, but economic institutions will need redesign (e.g., safety nets or new social arrangements) if AI becomes broadly cheaper and more capable—and stresses that achieving these benefits will require deliberate governance, cooperative choices by companies and states, and continued focus on preventing catastrophic risks as well as spreading benefits equitably.
