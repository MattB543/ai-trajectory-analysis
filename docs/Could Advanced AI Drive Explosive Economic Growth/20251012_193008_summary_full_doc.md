Tom Davidson investigates whether “explosive growth” (>>30% annual GWP) by 2100 is plausible, weighing long-run data, growth theory, expert opinion, and objections, and concludes it is economically plausible though far from certain: long-run (10,000 BCE–present) GWP shows super‑exponential patterns that endogenous, idea‑based models explain via increasing returns to accumulable inputs (more ideas → more output → more people → more ideas), but the demographic transition after ~1880 broke the pre‑modern feedback (more output no longer → more people) and helps explain the steady ~2% frontier GDP/capita growth since 1900 that underlies the “standard story” (semi‑endogenous models predict sub‑exponential growth as population growth slows); crucially, if advanced AI either (a) makes labor accumulable again (AI “robots” or virtual workers) or (b) raises capital’s substitutability for labor (elasticity of substitution >1 or rapid task automation), many growth models (and adjusted versions of long‑run models) predict a powerful feedback (more output → more AI capital → more output) that can produce super‑exponential and even explosive growth for plausible parameters, whereas counter‑arguments—experts’ low tail probabilities, the unprecedented magnitude of 30% growth, evidence of diminishing returns to R&D, possible essential unautomatable tasks or other bottlenecks, and model pathologies (e.g., knife‑edge assumptions, implied singularities)—are important but not decisive; empirically, long‑run explosive models (e.g. Roodman) often predict earlier explosion than a more serially‑correlated, recent‑data‑weighted “growth‑multiplier” outside view, and Davidson synthesizes these lines to assign >10% probability to explosive growth this century (roughly ~30% by his current judgment, combining a ~30% or higher chance of sufficiently advanced AI with ~1/3 conditional chance it triggers explosion), while also treating stagnation/sub‑exponential outcomes as highly plausible and calling for further empirical and theoretical work to narrow uncertainty.
