This scenario envisions a plausible 2035 in which societies deliberately scaled and steered “Tool AI” — highly capable but deliberately non‑agentic, interpretable systems — producing a burst of progress described as a “century in a decade” while preserving human oversight; key triggers include early 2025–26 failures (a healthcare class action and autonomous trading collapse) that led to a landmark Supreme Court–style AI liability framework imposing strict liability on systems combining high autonomy, generality, and intelligence and creating safe harbors for constrained tools, which together with insurer refusals, legal pressure, and technical advances in interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and constitutional-AI oversight drove a market pivot to narrow, auditable systems. Between 2027–2035, investment in alignment, oversight infrastructure, and standardized safety audits enabled breakthroughs (universal flu vaccine, targeted cancer immunotherapies, fusion materials, room‑temperature superconductors, lunar base coordination), widespread Tool AI adoption across science, healthcare, education, climate/energy, governance, law, and the economy, and policy responses (UBI pilots, capital‑dividend funds, predistribution, antitrust measures) that reduced paid work hours and improved health and public services for many; but the world is strained by job displacement in knowledge sectors, uneven access and wealth concentration, geopolitical two‑track deployment (Western constrained models vs. more autonomous Chinese domestic systems), scandals over rubber‑stamp “human‑in‑the‑loop” use, persistent validation bottlenecks, and continuous pressure to “add agency,” leaving the Tool AI equilibrium productive yet fragile and requiring sustained legal, technical, and cultural enforcement.
