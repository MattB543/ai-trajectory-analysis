This paper argues that the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) threatens to reshape the narrow corridor that sustains liberal democracies by shifting the balance between state capacity and individual liberty in two opposing directions—toward a “despotic Leviathan” through unprecedented surveillance, perfect enforcement, and centralized control, or toward an “absent Leviathan” as AGI-empowered non‑state actors erode state legitimacy and governability—and traces how these dynamics operate across three channels: micro-level automation of discretionary decision‑making (where artificial bureaucrats could both improve efficiency, equity, and responsiveness and undermine transparency, accountability, and moral judgment), meso-level reconfiguration of organizational form (where AGI can push administrations toward highly centralized system‑level bureaucracies or enable new AI‑native coordination structures), and macro-level changes to democratic feedback (from AI-mediated mass deliberation and “digital twins” to risks of manipulation, alignment failures, and loss of civic dignity). Drawing on recent advances in large language models, scaling laws, and real-world government AI deployments, the authors identify concrete failure modes—legibility arms races, monitoring/compliance cost collapses, control centralization, technical inscrutability, and diffusion to malicious actors—and propose a governance agenda to keep societies within the corridor: deploy privacy‑enhancing technologies, invest in mechanistic interpretability and explainable AI, design hybrid human–AI institutions that preserve meaningful oversight and contestability, adapt regulatory and antitrust frameworks, build robust identity and accountability mechanisms, and pursue anticipatory, experimental policymaking (from sandboxes to international norms) to stress‑test socio‑technical arrangements. They conclude that AGI can amplify both democratic virtues and authoritarian risks and that preserving freedom will require deliberate institutional innovation, technical safeguards, and political resolve to ensure AGI strengthens rather than subverts rule of law, transparency, and democratic control.
