In "AI as Normal Technology" (Narayanan & Kapoor, April 15, 2025) the authors advance a coherent worldview that treats AI as a powerful but ordinary general‑purpose technology—one whose social and economic effects will be realized through distinct stages of invention (methods), innovation (products), and diffusion (adoption), not by an inevitable emergence of a separate, uncontrollable “superintelligence.” They argue that diffusion—especially in safety‑critical domains—is slow for technical, organizational, legal, and epistemic reasons, that benchmarks overstate real‑world impact, and that important limits (capability‑reliability gaps, tacit organizational knowledge, safety regulation and privacy constraints) make dramatic, sudden economic disruption unlikely; instead, AI will reshape work by shifting humans toward oversight, specification, and control of AI systems. On risks, they classify five types—accidents, arms races, misuse, misalignment, and systemic socio‑political harms—and conclude that most hazards are best addressed downstream (hardening infrastructure, monitoring, sectoral regulation, defensive AI tools) while catastrophic misalignment remains speculative and should be investigated rather than assumed. They warn that nonproliferation and heavy centralization are infeasible or counterproductive—creating monocultures, single points of failure, and reduced defensive capacity—and instead advocate resilience as the central policy objective: reduce uncertainty through transparency, incident reporting, whistleblower protections, government inventories and research funding; build technical and institutional prerequisites (AI literacy, polycentric regulation, international cooperation); strengthen societal resilience (labor supports, press and democratic institutions); and cautiously promote competition and broad access to defensive capabilities. They recommend nuanced, sector‑specific regulation that preserves experimentation and diffusion where appropriate (and avoids freezing categories that would stifle useful adoption), prioritize downstream defenses and monitoring over model‑centric bans, and treat alignment and human‑in‑the‑loop approaches as part of a larger toolkit of controls. Overall the paper offers predictions (gradual diffusion and economic change, limited superhuman persuasion/forecasting), prescribes pragmatic, resilience‑oriented governance, and urges evidence gathering and flexible policymaking to navigate deep uncertainty rather than betting on extreme scenarios.
