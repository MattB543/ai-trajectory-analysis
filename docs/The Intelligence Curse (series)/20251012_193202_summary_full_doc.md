The Intelligence Curse argues that imminent AGI threatens to make ordinary human labor economically irrelevant—triggering “pyramid replacement” as AI first freezes hiring and then displaces entry-level through senior roles—so that capital, resources, and control over AI concentrate power and freeze social mobility much like the historical resource curse; absent intervention this could shatter the social contract, produce entrenched, possibly authoritarian elites, collapse wages, and even risk catastrophe. The authors diagnose why powerful actors will lose incentives to invest in people, marshal evidence on rapid AI capability growth and economic modeling that predicts falling labor shares, and outline a three-part strategy to avoid this default trajectory: avert (build defensive safety, biosecurity, cybersecurity, interpretability and control technologies and fund government moonshots to prevent warning-shot centralizations), diffuse (extend a human-in-the-loop period by prioritizing human-augmenting interfaces, local fine-tuning, open-source and affordable compute, user-aligned personal agents, robotics decentralization, upskilling, and bans on AIs owning assets), and democratize (strengthen democratic institutions, faster courts/legislatures, digital representation, verification tools, transparent auditing, sovereign wealth or redistribution mechanisms). They stress differential technological development to steer the tech tree, warn against locking down AGI (which would empower rentier outcomes), and conclude with concrete calls for governments, labs, VCs, researchers, and citizens to act now to preserve human relevance and prevent a static, unequal future.
