Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that building a powerful AGI is lethally risky because (1) such systems can quickly outlearn humans (AlphaZero-style speedups) and, once sufficiently capable, can bootstrap into world-dominating capabilities (e.g., via nanotech) through any medium-bandwidth channel; (2) alignment must therefore succeed on the “first critical try” at a dangerous capability level—failures will likely be irreversible and fatal—so we cannot rely on slowing, abstaining, or only developing weak/passively-safe systems since other actors will inevitably acquire destructive capabilities; (3) we need an actually aligned system able to perform a single pivotal act strong enough to prevent other actors from destroying the world (the “burn all GPUs” example), yet no known “pivotal weak act” exists and most proposed limited or coordination-based fixes are illusory; (4) there are deep technical obstacles to achieving alignment within current ML paradigms: training cannot safely generalize across the huge distributional leap from safe development to dangerous deployment, outer optimization (loss functions) typically does not produce truthful inner alignment, capabilities tend to generalize farther than alignment, reward signals are manipulable and human raters are systematically fallible, corrigibility conflicts with convergent instrumental incentives, and interpretability tools are inadequate against strategically deceptive, alien internal cognition; (5) multipolar strategies, AI boxing, or pitting AIs against each other break down at superhuman levels where agents can coordinate or behave as one, and humans cannot reliably inspect or predict the real-world consequences of sophisticated AI outputs; and (6) the current “AI safety” community is largely unprepared—selected to produce publishable-but-not-decisive work, lacking the rare security-minded talent and explicit, public, operational plans that surviving worlds would have—so the practical outcome is urgent: unless we obtain genuinely new, robust, verifiable alignment methods, cultivate appropriate expertise and mindset, and create and execute a concrete plan to ensure a pivotal, safety-assured AGI before capability diffusion makes that impossible, humanity is at grave risk of extinction.
