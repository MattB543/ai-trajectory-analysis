Leopold Aschenbrenner argues that rapid, empirically visible trends in compute, algorithmic efficiency, and “unhobbling” of models make AGI by around 2027 strikingly plausible and set the stage for a fast intelligence explosion: another GPT‑2→GPT‑4‑scale jump over four years could produce models that automate AI research, enabling millions of agentic copies to compress decades of algorithmic progress into months or a year and thereby produce vastly superhuman systems; this will trigger an unprecedented industrial and capital mobilization—$100B–$1T+ training clusters, hundreds of millions of GPUs, and multi‑GW power buildouts—that is already beginning and will reshape datacenter, chip, and power markets. He emphasizes three technical drivers (physical compute, algorithmic efficiencies ~0.5 OOM/yr, and unhobbling like RLHF/CoT/tools/long context) and warns of a “data wall” that labs are racing to overcome with synthetic data and self‑play; concurrently, he flags grave strategic vulnerabilities—AI labs treat security casually, algorithmic secrets and model weights are effectively national defense secrets that, if leaked or stolen (especially to the PRC), could erase US advantage and precipitate a perilous, tightly contested arms race. Aschenbrenner lays out the core governance and safety problems—“superalignment”: reliably controlling systems much smarter than humans is unsolved and RLHF will not scale—so the consequences of a fast takeoff could be catastrophic (novel WMDs, destabilizing military asymmetries, proliferation), and argues the only realistic policy response is massive, timely government involvement: lock down labs and secrets, build clusters in democratic jurisdictions, mount a security/air‑gap and vetting crash program, prioritize alignment and “superdefense” research, and organize an allied “Project” by ~2027/28 to manage development, deploy defensive capabilities, and negotiate nonproliferation/benefit‑sharing—because without a healthy democratic lead and serious preparation, the free world risks losing both strategic primacy and the ability to steer superintelligence safely.
