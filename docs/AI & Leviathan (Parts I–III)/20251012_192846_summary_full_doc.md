Samuel Hammond’s three-part essay argues that AI is an “x‑ray” microscope that will radically increase society’s informational resolution and therefore reshape institutions by altering transaction, search, and monitoring costs, forcing one of three responses—cultural adaptation, technical mitigation, or regulatory enforcement (the “AI Leviathan”)—while spontaneous restraint is unstable because of prisoner’s‑dilemma incentives; drawing historical parallels to the printing press and Hobbes’s Leviathan, Hammond warns that democratized AI could either empower surveillance states, shatter weak institutions into techno‑feudalist private enclaves, or produce state collapse as governments fail to adapt, and he highlights key tensions between open‑source accelerationists and safety/regulatory advocates, minority‑rule pathologies (where a small intolerant group sets norms), and the shifting balance of public vs. private power as AI diffuses faster through commerce than law. He frames governments and firms through Coasean transaction‑cost logic—monitoring costs falling will expand bureaucratic control or, paradoxically, hollow it out as private providers supply formerly public goods—and urges liberal democracies to pursue a third way of institutional co‑evolution (embracing defensive AI, updating oversight, and renegotiating the social contract) rather than surrendering to totalitarian monitoring or atomizing into gated, AI‑fortified company towns. Finally, Hammond sketches a default timeline (2024–2045) in which synthetic content floods the web, enterprise AI automates knowledge work, AGI‑level models emerge around the late 2020s–early 2030s causing massive labor reallocation and bimodal markets, private platforms and arbitration supplant many regulatory functions, robotics and cheap energy enable local production and fortified micro‑jurisdictions, and by the mid‑2040s powerful actors may privately train near‑superintelligences—underscoring that even if intermediate AI stages aren’t existentially catastrophic, their institutional consequences could determine whether humanity ends up under an AI Leviathan, in techno‑feudal fiefdoms, or on a healthier co‑evolutionary path.
