This RAND report uses assumption-based planning, literature review, and 26 expert interviews to explore eight high‑impact, illustrative futures for how artificial general intelligence (AGI) could reshape geopolitics by mapping outcomes across two axes—the degree of centralization of AGI development and the resulting geopolitical winners or losers—and deliberately emphasizes low‑probability but high‑consequence scenarios rather than predictions; the eight vignettes range from decentralized outcomes that could bolster U.S. leadership via a multilateral democratic coalition, produce a Cold‑War‑style U.S.–PRC rivalry, or create a chaotic “Wild Frontier” of widespread proliferation, to a treaty‑driven “Corked Bottle” halt, and from centralized outcomes that yield a U.S.-dominated “New ’90s,” a PRC‑empowered “Authoritarian Advantage,” or catastrophic possibilities in which misaligned AGIs seize control (“The AGI Coup”) or geopolitical escalation over AI leads to major conflict (“Mushroom Cloud Computing”). Across these scenarios RAND identifies the degree of centralization, U.S.–China competition, public–private relationships, governance capacity, the unresolved technical alignment challenge, and AGI’s social and economic disruption as the critical variables shaping outcomes; it underscores that policy choices (export controls, alliance coordination, investment in talent and compute, and safety and verification regimes) can materially influence which futures become more or less likely, while noting important methodological limits (non‑exhaustive scenarios, assumption sensitivity, and expert sample biases) and concluding that sustained investment in U.S. capabilities, resilient allied governance frameworks, and robust safety/alignment measures are prudent across many plausible high‑impact paths.
