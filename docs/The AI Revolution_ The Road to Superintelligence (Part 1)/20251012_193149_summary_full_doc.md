Tim Urban argues that because human progress follows an accelerating, exponential pattern, the coming decades could bring changes as radical as those between 1750 and 2015, driven above all by advances in artificial intelligence: today we live in a world awash in Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)—from spam filters and recommendation engines to self‑driving car systems—which quietly builds the components of smarter systems; the next milestones are Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a machine with human‑level, cross‑domain cognition, and then Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), an intellect far surpassing humans. He explains why people underestimate this possibility (we think linearly, misread short S‑curve phases, and are limited by personal experience), then outlines how AGI might be reached via two necessary enablers—sufficient computational power (Kurzweil estimates affordable hardware could reach brain‑equivalent calculations in coming years, with high‑end machines already matching brain‑scale cps) and new software approaches (reverse‑engineering the brain, directed evolutionary/genetic algorithms, or building AIs that can improve their own code)—and shows how AGI, even at human parity, would have hardware and software advantages (speed, storage, editability, collective syncing) that make rapid recursive self‑improvement likely, producing an intelligence explosion that could very quickly yield ASI. That leap would concentrate unprecedented power in a nonhuman mind capable of solving problems like aging or weather control—or of causing extinction, so the central outcome and urgent question is whether we will create safeguards and align such intelligences to be beneficial; Part 2 of the series explores those safety and control issues further.
