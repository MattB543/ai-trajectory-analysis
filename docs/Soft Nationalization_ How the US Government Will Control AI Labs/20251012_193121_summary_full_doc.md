This report introduces and argues for the concept of “soft nationalization” — a likely U.S. trajectory in which the government progressively increases control over frontier AI labs by combining a spectrum of policy levers rather than pursuing wholesale, immediate state ownership — because total nationalization would be legally, politically, financially, and practically fraught and would likely undermine U.S. innovation. The authors outline why the U.S. will act (to preserve military and technological superiority as advanced AI creates risks like lethal autonomous weapons, cyberwarfare, economic disruption, and an AI arms race) and catalog thirteen broad policy-lever categories spanning management and governance (monitoring, permanent liaisons, board seats, joint programs, unified agencies), operational controls (milestone reporting, pre-approval or licensing of large training runs, use-case and customer restrictions, compute reporting, caps, export controls, or centralized allocation), security and containment (clearances, talent mobility limits, classified research, IP co-ownership, sandboxing, human-in-the-loop mandates, on/off switches, audits), and financial ownership and control (minority stakes, golden shares, majority or full acquisitions, profit regulation and special taxes). They illustrate these tools through plausible scenarios — a 2027 “brain drain” prompting talent restrictions and government-funded joint research; a 2029 arms-race escalation driving defense partnerships, export controls, board representation, and compute permits; and a 2035 biotech crisis leading to full acquisition, nationalized employment, IP seizure, R&D bans, and centralized agency control — showing how combinations of levers can achieve national-security aims with varying intervention levels from light oversight to de facto ownership. The report emphasizes it is descriptive, not prescriptive, notes important tradeoffs (e.g., risks of concentrating power or dampening innovation), and announces further research to map legal feasibility, externalities, and how AI-safety objectives might be aligned with or shaped by likely soft-nationalization pathways.
