      "quote": "AI safety means different things to different people, but whether the focus is job loss or the x-risk from an unaligned superintelligence, the concerns are always presented as relatively first-order. That is, AI safety is usually conceptualized in terms of what AI will do directly, rather than in terms of AI's likely indirect, second-order effects on society and the shape of our institutions. This is an enormous blind spot."
